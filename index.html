<h1>Personal Infomation</h1>

<p>Geoffrey steven Davis</p> 

<p>s3930693</p> 

<p>s3930693@student.rmit.edu.au </p>

<h1>Basic Infomation</h1>

<p>My name is Geoffrey Davis, I am 27 years of age and currently live in far north QLD Australia. I'm an Australian citizen and unfortunately only speak English, I have though been lucky enough to have lived overseas for several years. I graduated high school in 2011 and then went on the starting a 4-year apprenticeship as a heavy diesel fitter, after completing my apprenticeship I had the opportunity to go work on a copper mine in Zambia (Africa) where I was based for 2 years working for the construction team finalizing the mine as it was in the process of getting build. After my stint in Africa, I returned to Australia where I have been working in several industries such as hospitality and mechanic. My passion is WW2 aircraft, I love the background and history of the aircraft as well as the mechanics behind them, the mechanics behind dogfighting intrigue me and the skill that was required to fly back in the 1940s, I build model planes when I get time as well as fly on WW2 flight simulators.</p>

<h1>Intrest In IT</h1>

<p>My interest in IT started when I was a young boy, I've been a gamer since I can remember and I think because of that my interest in IT just grew from there. When I got my first computer, I started doing things like downloading games and movies through torrents as back then my internet wasn’t so great so I could only really play single player games, after a bit I started to mod games and would run into Erros with files and system errors, being determined I use to scour the web trying to find the solution to the problem whether it be changing the games settings in notepad or changing IPs etc, all so I could solve the problem. While doing so I found myself really enjoying the fault-finding process and the satisfaction achieved when I finally fixed the issue. Ever since then my knowledge has grown and I find myself wanting to dig deeper in the system and structure of computers and programs. I get a big kick from the programming side of things and as I've only just scratched the surface, I want to expand my knowledge. As stated, my experience in IT has basically been self-taught but I have been working with and around computers since I was a young boy and have a pretty could understanding of the fundamentals. I have chosen to start study with RMIT as I'm at the age where I've had a chance to try several different fields of work and have always found myself wanting something more, I've always wanted to work in IT I just never made the leap forward to make a start. But now I have just had my first child I have made the decision to make an effort and going for it. I hope to be able to one day work from home allowing me to spend more time with my daughter and be able to travel. By starting my introduction into IT and introduction into programming I hope to get a good start in understanding the basics of programming and a good insight into what IT path I want to go down.</p>

<h3>Job Requirements</h3>

<p>This job requires a developer programmer to complete several tasks such as build, maintain and modify the code for software application in Microsoft and open-source technologies, scope analysis, solution analysis and technical design. The job of a developer programmer appeals to me as I am partially interested in coding as well as the idea of managing and designs data management systems, even though this is not a work from home job it's definitely something I could see myself working towards in the future. </P>

<h3>Experiance required for the job</h3>

<p>For this particular job a lot of previous experience is required in multiple fields, this includes such things such as having several years' experience in. 

Master data management and data warehouse tools,  

Working with Microsoft web development products, open-source platforms and architecture  

Programs such as C#, ASP.NET/ java, Microsoft SQL server,

<h3>Current qualifications that i have and how i plan to build on my knowledge to achieve this goal</h3>

<p>Currently I don’t have any qualifications that match's the requirements in the job advertised but having a look at the job and the description gives me a good idea on the areas that I'm going to need to focus on to one day be able to achieve a job with a similar description. My plan for getting to the goal is to continue my study through RMIT and hope to achieve a bachelor of information technology by the time I am through as well as completing all coding courses offered by RMIT. While studying I plan to find an entry level job into the IT industry to get a foot in the door, as good as study is I feel personally you achieve more knowledge and gain more skills by being hands on and learning face to face with industry professionals. I feel that if I follow these steps and keep progressing through the IT industry, I'll be able to one day have the skill set required to take on the position of a developer programmer. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<h3>I have completed three personal test and attatched the results below as well as some reflection comments underneath on how they will help me in group situations</h3>

<h2>Myers-Brigg's test results</h2>

<p>
<li>Personality type: Consul (ESFJ-A)</li> 
<li>Traits: Extraverted – 79%</li>
<li>Observant – 64%</li>
<li>Feeling – 54%</li>
<li>Judging – 79%</li>
<li>Assertive – 57%</li> 
<li>Role: Sentinel</li> 
<li>Strategy: People Mastery</li>
</p>

<h2>Educational learner learning test results</h2>

<p>
<li>Auditory-40%</li>
<li>Visual-40%</li>
<li>Tactile-20%</li>
</p>

<p>You are a Auditory/Visual learner</p>

<h2>Test my creativity-creativity test results</h2>

<img src="Creativity.jpg" width="639" height="405" border="0" alt="" />

<h3>What these test results mean to me</h3>

<p>After completing all three test I can see that my results speak a bit of truth in the way that they are relevant to my personality and my attributes. For the first test I got the result CONSUL which brings some strong attributers to the team environment like strong practical skills meaning scheduling and prioritizing task for assignments as well as forming a great connection with others which is a key part of team projects. My results for my learning test show me that I learn best when I'm listening to and visually watching what I'm being taught, I also learn faster when I'm learning hands on. The creativity test showed that I was pretty well rounded but do well with the ability to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information. </P>

<h3>How i believe the results will influence my behaviour in a team</h3>

<p>Looking at my results I think they will give me some key attributes that I can bring into a team environment. A big one is my ability to work well as a team. I'm very confident in myself and love to makes things work so that everyone is happy and no one is left out, this is key to a group effort because if everyone is happy and being involved the overall effort and results of the task are greatly improved. Being an audible and visual learning will help me in a team project as I can actively discuss ideas and be hands on with the project. Going off my creativity results I think I need to work on my creativity a bit but being in a group and bouncing ideas to each other will help me improve my creativity. </p>

<h3>How im going to take these results into acount when forming a team</h3>

<p>Using the results from the three test I can see my strong points and weak points so when forming a team, I need to look for people who may lack what strengths I have but are stronger in my weak areas, doing so will make the group overall balanced in all aspects and providing an overall better result. </p>

<h1>Project Idea</h1>

<h3>Employer management APP</h3>

<p>My project idea is going to be designing an app for work, the idea of the app is to allow for easy clocking in and clocking off as well as having alarms for your breaks, The app will also include all your personal information for easy access such as licenses and medical conditions. The idea being that if you are if another staff member needs to know anything about you they can open their app and get the required information. Obviously for security purposes not all your information will just be revealed to everyone more so managers and the appropriate staff.  </P>

<h3>My motivation behind the idea</h3>

<p>I believe this app will be a great addition to the workforce as having a live tracker of your work day allows for accurate and reliable data, it will allow your boss/manager to see exactly what time you're arriving to work as well as when you're having your breaks and when you're clocking off. The idea of having all your credentials available from one source is to make task like presenting your RSA to licensing or your mining permits to officers an easy and non-time-consuming task. I have personally been in the workforce for about 10 years now and there are similar apps like Xero:<a href="https://www.xero.com/au/try-now/accounting/xero-accounting-software/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzce3htDp9AIVaJJmAh2PfQC1EAAYASAAEgJuP_D_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds/">Xero Website Link</a>. Xero is an accounting app that allows the employer to manage pays and pay slips, but the down side of the app is that the staff just enter their hours into the app and it's hard for the employer to track what hours the staff have actually achieved. There are systems in place for desktops already which do the task but they Arnt very useful for jobs that are outside of the office like on the mines or a farm hence a portable system is a great idea.</P>

<h3>Kry features of the APP design</h3>

<p>The whole idea behind the app is to make the tracking of employees easier and more viable. One of the key features as discussed above is the ability to check into jobs with your own mobile device. The app will have a feature where the employer can have certain task and jobs inputted into the system for the day, week or even month. After inputting the jobs, the employer can add things like time stamps to let the employee know what their time schedule is for the task and add notes for the employee to read. The employee once clocked on will be alerted by the app when they are required to have breaks and when they are getting close to their finish time, they will also be able to communicate with the employer about adding more time etc. if the job requires it. Having this feature gives the employer a more accurate idea of what times their employees are working and also making sure they are taking breaks when required. The other key feature of the app is the ability to store and upload key documents. These documents can include things like RSA, s, white cards, permits, medical details etc. The idea being is that if you're on a job for example working in hospitality and licensing come into the venue to check everyone's credentials, instead of the employer having to dig through files or sift through emails they can access everyone's details from the app saving time and making for an easy access solution. This also come into play with medical history of employees, say and employee at work as a condition like epilepsy but the new manager on the job isn't aware of the, all they would have to do is quickly bring up the employees' profile and will know what is happening in this case the employee has epilepsy and the required action can be taken. The app like Xero will have all employees pay details in one place, as everything is on the one app the employee's hours will also be easily available for the account and by doing this it also makes it easy for times to be approved by the employer. </p>

<h3>Tools and software that will be used for the task</h3>

<p>To carry out this project I plan on using MIT App Inventor, a web application integrated development environment. It’s a great tool for beginner programmers and works on both major platforms Android and IOS. Its graphical user interface (GUI) uses programming languages similar to Scratch and StarLogo, allowing users to drag and drop to create an application to run on android, the iOS program is still in development so for this project I will stick with android. </p>

<h3>Required skills for the task ahead</h3>

<p>To complete this project the main skill that will be required is to be able to use MIT App Inventors block-based programming language based on Google Blocky, but using Mit App Inventure is not a daunting task as the basics of the program are pretty straight forward and the website provides multiple tutorials all the way from beginner to advanced. I believe finding people with the skills and knowledge of the software won't be a hard task as stated before even if the user has next to know experience the program itself offers a vast range of methods to help users along the way. The app itself is free to use making it viable and easy for anyone to get their hands taking a lot of stress out of starting the task. </p>

<h3>Summary of overall project</h3>

<p>If the team is able to complete the task and we are successful in completing a working app, it will be a great confidents booster to me personally as working with code and creating programs is defiantly a career path I want to peruse. By completing the task successfully, it will inspire me to move on to bigger and better projects and help me gain the knowledge and experience in programming required for certain jobs like the one discussed in this assignment. </p>
