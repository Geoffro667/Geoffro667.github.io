<p>Geoffrey steven Davis</p>

<h1>Basic Infomation</h1>

<p>My name is Geoffrey Davis, I am 27 years of age and currently live in far north QLD Australia. I'm an Australian citizen and unfortunately only speak English, I have though been lucky enough to have lived overseas for several years. I graduated high school in 2011 and then went on the starting a 4-year apprenticeship as a heavy diesel fitter, after completing my apprenticeship I had the opportunity to go work on a copper mine in Zambia (Africa) where I was based for 2 years working for the construction team finalizing the mine as it was in the process of getting build. After my stint in Africa, I returned to Australia where I have been working in several industries such as hospitality and mechanic. My passion is WW2 aircraft, I love the background and history of the aircraft as well as the mechanics behind them, the mechanics behind dogfighting intrigue me and the skill that was required to fly back in the 1940s, I build model planes when I get time as well as fly on WW2 flight simulators.</p>

<h1>Intrest In IT</h1>

<p>My interest in IT started when I was a young boy, I've been a gamer since I can remember and I think because of that my interest in IT just grew from there. When I got my first computer, I started doing things like downloading games and movies through torrents as back then my internet wasn’t so great so I could only really play single player games, after a bit I started to mod games and would run into Erros with files and system errors, being determined I use to scour the web trying to find the solution to the problem whether it be changing the games settings in notepad or changing IPs etc, all so I could solve the problem. While doing so I found myself really enjoying the fault-finding process and the satisfaction achieved when I finally fixed the issue. Ever since then my knowledge has grown and I find myself wanting to dig deeper in the system and structure of computers and programs. I get a big kick from the programming side of things and as I've only just scratched the surface, I want to expand my knowledge. As stated, my experience in IT has basically been self-taught but I have been working with and around computers since I was a young boy and have a pretty could understanding of the fundamentals. I have chosen to start study with RMIT as I'm at the age where I've had a chance to try several different fields of work and have always found myself wanting something more, I've always wanted to work in IT I just never made the leap forward to make a start. But now I have just had my first child I have made the decision to make an effort and going for it. I hope to be able to one day work from home allowing me to spend more time with my daughter and be able to travel. By starting my introduction into IT and introduction into programming I hope to get a good start in understanding the basics of programming and a good insight into what IT path I want to go down.</p>

<h3>Job Requirements</h3>

<p>This job requires a developer programmer to complete several tasks such as build, maintain and modify the code for software application in Microsoft and open-source technologies, scope analysis, solution analysis and technical design. The job of a developer programmer appeals to me as I am partially interested in coding as well as the idea of managing and designs data management systems, even though this is not a work from home job it's definitely something I could see myself working towards in the future. </P>

<h3>Experiance required for the job</h3>

<p>For this particular job a lot of previous experience is required in multiple fields, this includes such things such as having several years' experience in. 

Master data management and data warehouse tools,

<p>Currently I don’t have any qualifications that match's the requirements in the job advertised but having a look at the job and the description gives me a good idea on the areas that I'm going to need to focus on to one day be able to achieve a job with a similar description. My plan for getting to the goal is to continue my study through RMIT and hope to achieve a bachelor of information technology by the time I am through as well as completing all coding courses offered by RMIT. While studying I plan to find an entry level job into the IT industry to get a foot in the door, as good as study is I feel personally you achieve more knowledge and gain more skills by being hands on and learning face to face with industry professionals. I feel that if I follow these steps and keep progressing through the IT industry, I'll be able to one day have the skill set required to take on the position of a developer programmer. </p>

<h1>Personal Profile</h1>

<h3>I have completed three personal test and attatched the results below as well as some reflection comments underneath on how they will help me in group situations</h3>

<h2>Myers-Brigg's test results</h2>

<p>
<li>Personality type: Consul (ESFJ-A)</li> 
<li>Traits: Extraverted – 79%</li>

<h2>Test my creativity-creativity test results</h2>

<img src="../../../Pictures/Screenshots/Screenshot (7).png" width="739" height="405" border="0" alt="" />

<h3>What these test results mean to me</h3>

<p>After completing all three test I can see that my results speak a bit of truth in the way that they are relevant to my personality and my attributes. For the first test I got the result CONSUL which brings some strong attributers to the team environment like strong practical skills meaning scheduling and prioritizing task for assignments as well as forming a great connection with others which is a key part of team projects. My results for my learning test show me that I learn best when I'm listening to and visually watching what I'm being taught, I also learn faster when I'm learning hands on. The creativity test showed that I was pretty well rounded but do well with the ability to carry large quantities of information and be able to manipulate and manage the relationships between such information. </P>

<h3>How i believe the results will influence my behaviour in a team</h3>

<p>Looking at my results I think they will give me some key attributes that I can bring into a team environment. A big one is my ability to work well as a team. I'm very confident in myself and love to makes things work so that everyone is happy and no one is left out, this is key to a group effort because if everyone is happy and being involved the overall effort and results of the task are greatly improved. Being an audible and visual learning will help me in a team project as I can actively discuss ideas and be hands on with the project. Going off my creativity results I think I need to work on my creativity a bit but being in a group and bouncing ideas to each other will help me improve my creativity. </p>

<h3>How im going to take these results into acount when forming a team</h3>

<p>Using the results from the three test I can see my strong points and weak points so when forming a team, I need to look for people who may lack what strengths I have but are stronger in my weak areas, doing so will make the group overall balanced in all aspects and providing an overall better result. </p>
